# Resilience Coffee

## What

A twice monthly virtual meetup discussing topics related to resilience engineering. We loosely follow a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) format.

## Why

We are more resilient when we learn from each others' approaches and adapt.

## When

First Thursdays are [APAC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific) mornings and Americas' afternoons.

Third Fridays are [EMEA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe,_the_Middle_East_and_Africa) afternoons and Americas' mornings.

## Where and How

Please [email us for an invite](mailto:invite@resilience-coffee.org)!
